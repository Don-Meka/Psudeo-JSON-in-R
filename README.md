I was trying to work with some text data of AMazon reviews. I had difficulty processing hte data i nR. I thought it was a JSON file, but it turned out to be some psudeo JSON. I don't know much about JSON so I can't explain what the problem was in detail. Good thing is this code fixed the problem of psudeo JSON.
